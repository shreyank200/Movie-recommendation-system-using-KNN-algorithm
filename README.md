Introduction
This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using the KNN algorithm. The system recommends movies to users based on the similarity of their ratings to other users. By analyzing the patterns in user ratings, the system suggests movies that a user is likely to enjoy.

Dataset
The project uses two datasets:

Movies: Contains information about the movies such as movie ID, title, and genres.
Ratings: Contains user ratings for the movies including user ID, movie ID, rating, and timestamp.
